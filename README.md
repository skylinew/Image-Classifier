# Image Classifer
A face and digit image (preprocessed) detector implemented with [Naive Bayes](**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier**) and [Perceptron](**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron**) algorithms.


## Usage
Written in [**Python 2.7**](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)

Data for training, validation, and testing are included. For a quick demonstration, run either of the following in the project's root folder:

```python
python perceptron.py
```
or 

```python
python naiveBayes.py
```
Both scripts will print an accuracy for both face and digit images. Accuracy scores are based on the training and test data provided.
